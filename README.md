Simone Giertz, a YouTube celebrity famous for her hilarious robotics inventions, has announced her first hardware product for sale — the "Every Day Calendar" that keeps track of your daily goals and motivates you to develop good habits: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lpvy-xkSNA

Simone is running a Kickstarter campaign at https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simonegiertz/the-every-day-calendar and plans to ship the bamboo-framed gadget in December 2019.

Before the product ships, this web app serves as a virtual substitute of Every Day Calendar. It stores all your achievements in your browser without sending anything to the server.
